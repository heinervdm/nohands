 *
 * The BtHub is a single-instance object.  It must be instantiated by
 * the client application at start time.  BtHub maintains per-application
 * resources, including a connection to the local Service Discovery
 * Protocol daemon used to register and advertise available services.
 *
 * BtService derived objects encapsulate service-specific single instance
 * resources.  They are instantiated as needed by the client application,
 * and registered with BtHub via BtHub::AddService() and
 * BtHub::RemoveService().  Specifically, HfpService maintains a listening
 * RFCOMM socket so that audio gateway devices may initiate connections.
 * Service state is managed collectively by BtHub.  BtHub will invoke
 * the BtService::Start() and BtService::Stop() methods of each service
 * object when Bluetooth service availability changes, i.e. when a USB
 * Bluetooth HCI is inserted or removed.
 *
 * BtDevice objects are indexed and maintained by BtHub.  All BtDevice
 * objects in the index have unique addresses.  BtHub::GetDevice() can
 * be used to look up or instantiate a BtDevice record for a specific
 * Bluetooth address.  BtHub will also instantiate BtDevice objects
 * automatically when reporting device inquiry results.
 *
 * BtSession derived objects, including HfpSession, encapsulate resources
 * associated with an session of a service.  As an example, HfpSession
 * includes:
 * - The RFCOMM socket used to communicate with the device.
 * - Methods for controlling the device, e.g. HfpSession::CmdDial().
 * - Callbacks for notifying changes of the device state, e.g.
 * HfpSession::cb_NotifyConnection.
 *
 * BtSession objects are @ref managed "managed objects" and are always
 * instantiated by their presiding BtService derived object.  They
 * can be instantiated manually, e.g. HfpService::GetSession(), or
 * automatically in response to remotely initiated connections.
 *
 * @section managed Managed Objects
 *
 * BtDevice and BtSession are managed objects, which derive from
 * BtManaged.  These objects are reference-counted.  When they
 * are deleted, they are deleted in a deferred fashion from a timer
 * event.  BtManaged objects also contain a pointer value reserved
 * for client use.  See BtManaged::SetPrivate().
 *
 * @section callbacks Callbacks
 *
 * As a rule, none of the callbacks provided by Bluetooth components
 * are ever invoked in a nested fashion from client method calls.  This
 * breaks potential recursive loops and complex situations that might
 * form if clients invoke method calls from callbacks, e.g.
 *
 * @code
 * Connect() ->
 *    HfpSession::cb_NotifyConnection -> 
 *       Disconnect() ->
 *          HfpSession::cb_NotifyConnection ->
 *             Connect() -> ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * A client may therefore invoke any method call from any callback without
 * having to worry about nested callbacks.  However, this requires
 * clients to be mindful of state transitions that they originate directly
 * with method calls.  For example, HfpSession::cb_NotifyConnection
 * is invoked when the state of the device connection changes, but only if
 * it changes by means other than the Connect() or Disconnect() methods.
 * The client must directly notice the effects of its calls to Connect()
 * and Disconnect(), rather than expecting all changes to be reported
 * through HfpSession::cb_NotifyConnection.

/**
 * @brief Bluetooth Device Record
 * @ingroup hfp
 *
 * This class represents a remote Bluetooth device that can connect
 * to local services or be connected to by local service handlers.
 * It supports numerous use cases:
 * - Identifying a device to be connected to, or an incoming connection
 * - Interrogating the Bluetooth name of the device
 *
 * @section bdlifecycle Life Cycle
 *
 * The associated BtHub object manages the life cycle of BtDevice
 * objects.  The BtHub keeps an index of BtDevice objects, and ensures
 * that every object has a unique Bluetooth address key.
 *
 * All BtDevice objects are instantiated by GetDevice() with create=true.
 * Service handlers such as HfpService will perform the instantiation
 * themselves in the case of devices remotely initating connections.
 *
 * BtDevice objects are reference-counted, and are always destroyed
 * when their reference count drops to zero.  Destruction is not
 * immediate and is executed in the context of a timer event.
 *
 * Service frontends such as HfpSession will retain references on their
 * underlying BtDevice objects, and the BtDevice will not be destroyed
 * until the service frontend is destroyed and its reference is removed.
 *
 * Clients may override the instantiation path for BtDevice objects by
 * registering their own factory method to BtHub::cb_BtDeviceFactory.
 * As part of a specialized factory, clients may use the default factory
 * method, BtHub::DefaultDevFactory().  A specialized factory may be
 * used to:
 * - Instantiate a class derived from BtDevice with additional
 * functionality.
 * - Register all relevant callbacks with the BtDevice object from a
 * single path, and before any may be invoked.
